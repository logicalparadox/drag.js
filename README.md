# drag.js

Drag.js is a very small javascript utility that facilitates UI drag and drop behavior. It currently has one dependancy of [Bean](https://github.com/fat/bean).

Now includes touch support. Tested on Android Honeycomb (Xoom). Looking for Apple testers! Visit [Documentation](https://logicalparadox.github.com/drag.js) on your touch device and try examples. Please leave feedback in Github Issues.

## Ender Integration

Got [Ender](http://ender.no.de)? Well, why not?

    $ npm install ender -g

Add drag.js to your existing Ender build:

    $ ender add drag

Like a boss :D

``` js
$('#content .dragme').drag()
  .axis('x')
  .container('#content')
  .end(function() {
    alert(this.pos.x + 'px, ' + this.pos.y + 'px');
  })
  .bind();
```
